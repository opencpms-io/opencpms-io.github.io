## The Beginning of OpenCPMS

### Nomen est Omen 
OpenCPMS is our contribution to provide a true open source system as a base 
for charge point operators who are looking for a lightweight and highly scalable charge point 
management system.  

### Why we launched the OpenCPMS project
We have been building software in the field of e-mobility and charging infrastructure for four years now.
I would say, if there is somewhere a highly emerging market in the field of mobility, than it is the 
race to build and run the charging infrastructure the electric vehicles will need in the upcoming years. 

Beside of the mandatory technical systems for the charging stations in the field, several - so called - 
"Charge Point Management Systems" emerged on the market. On the one hand developed and run as a 
shared cloud solution (SaaS solutions) like <a href="https://driivz.com">driivz</a> or 
<a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/de-de/partners/overview">be.ENERGISED</a> and on the other hand individually developed solutions to operate
for the own business. The latter systems were build e.q. for Allego, EnBW or Innogy. 

Companies that want to provide charging services to their customers, either as the main business or
as a complementary service (supermarkets or car park operators), have the choice. By partly outsourcing
the charge point management and integrate an existing cloud solution or by developing an own greenfield
solution. Both ways can be risky, reinforced by the fact that charge point management systems are highly integrated systems. And 
as everybody knows, integration makes software complex. Using an existing cloud solution gives you dependencies
which you might want to avoid in such a competing market. The development of an own greenfield solution
can take years and need the hiring of very good (and expensive) software developers due to the aforementioned
complexity.

We believe in Open Source. And therefore we believe that an open source framework for a flexible (adaptable)
charge point management that can be used in a professional environment should exist.

### The scope of OpenCPMS
In simple terms, OpenCPMS ist the basic system that is able to talk to and manage your charging stations in the field 
(using <a href="https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/">OCPP</a>). On the other side it integrates to your billing system and takes care of secure authentications.
A simple (as a basic implementation) administration frontend will give you insights about your charging infrastructure and
the historic and currently running transactions. Our aim is not to provide an out of the box (turn key solution). We want to 
provide you a framework that enables rapid development of your own system.

OpenCPMS emerges, but it is still in its infancy. So let us see, where the journey leads us...
