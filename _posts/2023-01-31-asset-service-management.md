## Why we use Atlassian for our Asset and Service Management

We started with our idea of [OpenCPMS Core]({% link index.md %}) as we believe in open source 
(see [The Beginning of OpenCPMS Core]({% post_url 2022-08-03-beginning-of-opencpms %}) for the whole story).
A matter of passion, if that's how you want to see it. We started to talk with CPOs and realized
that many of them are struggling with their asset and service management.

There are many Service Management solutions in the market. Big suppliers with powerful solutions.
So it does not make sense, to build such a system from scratch. Although it would have a charm to have 
such a system available as pure open source. So we decided to look for a stack that is easy
to extend and integrate with other systems. And then the air gets thin and the business of the 
big suppliers becomes opportunistic. 

In our opinion (so far) this does not apply for the Atlassian Stack. Atlassian allows easy extension
and extensive integration. We always say, Atlassian is build to integrate, whereas other solutions are 
build to prevent integration (or at least integrations not accepted by the solution provider or sold at
high prices).
